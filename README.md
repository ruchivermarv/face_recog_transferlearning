# face_recog_transferlearning

This is basically a mini-project that is created to learn the core concepts and deployment of a face recognition based Machine Learning model. It shows you how the fae recognition model can be trained using VGG16, MobileNet, and Resnet50. 
All the three are pre-trained architectures. We have to insert the input and output layers and train them according to our desired output.

The user simply has to give the location of the image set, including both trained and test set, and classify the number of classes of the dataset.
